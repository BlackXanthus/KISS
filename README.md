KISS
======
KISS is a *blazingly* fast launcher for android requiring nearly no memory to run.

This is is a fork of the project designed to help BlackXanthus better understand Launchers, and to add a few tools to the Launchers that he wants. This is not the offical project. Do not mistake it for one. 

This project is in an ALPHA stage

To get the offical version of KISS:

What is it?
------------
KISS is a fast launcher for your Android.

Search through your apps, contacts and settings lightning fast.
No more time spent trying to find the app you want to launch: enter a few characters of the name and hit enter.
Need to call someone? Don't meddle with the call log, just give three letters of their name and push the "phone" button.

KISS becomes smarter and smarter as you use it, pushing forward results you're more likely to select.
